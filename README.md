THIS REPOSITORY IS CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPLETING GDENG03. 
IN THIS REPOSITORY, I WILL KEEP MULTIPLE BRANCHES OF MY DIFFERENT
IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. THE MAIN BRANCH WILL 
MOSTLY CONTAIN CODE THAT HAS BEEN REFERENCED BY PARDCODE. THE OTHER
BRANCHES ARE THE CLASS-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATIONS.

IF YOU ARE NOT THE OWNER OF THIS REPOSITORY, NOR ARE YOU A PROFESSOR
FROM ONE OF MY CLASSES, PLEASE DO NOT VIEW THE CONTENTS OF THIS
REPOSITORY.

README FOR THE PURPOSE OF: RENDERING SYSTEM TEST CASE QUIZ
- main.cpp is the main file that allows the program to be run
- Cube.cpp contains the handling of cube appearance within the scene
- AppWindow.cpp is where cubes are being spawned, calling the constructor
  of Cube.cpp and its respective init() function to create it. Further,
  the cube's draw and update functions are called here respectively.

To run the program, simply run via Local Windows Debugger in Visual
Studio. The current state of the program has been pushed to accomplish
Question #6 in the list of test cases.
